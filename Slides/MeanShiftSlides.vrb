\frametitle{Dynamic scheduling}

\begin{itemize}
\item
The best scheduling strategy for this algorithm is the \textit{dynamic scheduling}, where the iterations are assigned to the threads while the loop is executing.
\item
To perform a dynamic scheduling we have to write in the \verb"pragma" statement the clause \verb"schedule(dynamic)".
